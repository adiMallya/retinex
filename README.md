## Motivation

The retinex theory was developed by Land and McCann to model how the human visual system perceives a scene. While exploring more on this attempt by the retinex theory as a part of my course project on image enhancement, I came across this paper on multi-scale retinex that tries to enhance an image with more focus on the color enhancemnt step.

Read up the [Jupyter notebook](notebook.ipynb) for the usage.
